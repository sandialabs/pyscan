# Install the QICK library on the runner (a QICK board) and run tests.
# The FPGA can only be accessed as root, so the tests must run with sudo.
# This pollutes the repo with files owned by root, which interfere with the "clean" step in the checkout action.
# We therefore do the clean manually (with sudo) before checkout.
